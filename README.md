- 👋 Hi, I’m @KieranWitt.
<br></br>
I'm a product and project management in the financial sector. Day to day I develop financial products, like investments and in the past mortgages, credit cards and loans and by night I come up with ideas to solve problems I've experienced in my life or observed in passing.
I also like to think I'm an entrepreneur in the making having started a business called [Impact Score](https://impactscore.co.uk/) that uses technology to make the world a better place, but more on that another time. 
<br></br>
Over the years, and probably like millions of others around the world, I've accumulated a long list of ideas and resigned them to a dusty notebook 
where they'll fester forever if I didn't do something about them. The ideas list has been growing but my skills in bringing those ideas to life haven't, 
with this in mind I recently decided to learn to code and would do it by bringing some of my ideas to life and [documenting the journey here!](https://kieranwitt.com/).

- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning to code and writing about the experience. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to... Code! I'm starting with Javascript and will work my way through other langauges and concepts over time. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything that solves a real world problem. 
- 📫 You can reach me at Kieran_019@hotmail.com
